								<p>
									<span>I feel as if I could devour the days</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Till the time came when I shall gain mine end;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>God shall have made me ruler, and all worlds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Signed the sublime recognizance. Till then⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even as a boat lies rocking on the beach,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Waiting the one white wave to float it free,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wait I the great event;⁠—too great it seems.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet, Lord, thou knowest that the power I seek</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is but for others’ good and Thine own glory,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the desire for it inspired by Thee.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So use me as I use it. Thou hast passed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thy word that such I shall enjoy, and then</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My mission is accomplished in this world.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I go unto another, where all souls</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Begin again, or take, up life from where</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Death broke it at. I cannot think there will be</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like disproportion there between our powers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And will, as here; if not, I shall be happy.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I feel no bounds. I cannot think but thought</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On thought springs up, illimitably, round,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As a great forest sows itself; but here</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There is nor ground nor light enough to live.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could I, I would be every where at once,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like the sea, for I feel as if I could</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Spread out my spirit o’er the endless world,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And act at all points:⁠—I am bound to one.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I must be here, and there, and everywhere,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or I am nowhere. Sense, flesh, fueling, fail</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Before the feet of the imperious mind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To which they are but as the dust she treads⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Windlike treads o’er, uplifts and leaves behind.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How mind will act with body glorified</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And spiritualized, and senses fined,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And pointed brilliantwise, we know not. Here</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even, it may be wrong in us to deem</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The senses degradations, otherwise</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than as fine steps, whereby the Queenly soul</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Comes down from her bright throne to view the mass</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She hath dominion over, and the things</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of her inheritance; and reascends,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With an indignant fiery purity,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not to be touched, her seat. The visible world,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whereby God maketh Nature known to us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is not derogatory to Himself</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As the pure Spirit Infinite. A world</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is but, perhaps, a sense of God’s, by which</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He may explain His nature, and receive</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fit pleasure. But the hour is hard at hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When Time’s grey wing shall winnow all away,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The atoms of the earth, the stars of Heaven;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When the created and Creator mind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall know each other, worlds and bodies both</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Put off for aye; man and his Maker meet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where all, who through the universe do well,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Embrace their heart’s desire; what things they will,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And whom remember; live, too, where they list;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with the beings they love best, and God,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Inherit and inhabit boundless bliss.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hear me, all-favouring God! my latest prayer;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou unto whom all nations of the world</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lift up their hearts, like grass-blades to the sun;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou who hast all things and hast need of nought;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou who hast given me Earth and all it holds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Give me, from out Thy garner stored with good,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some sign, Lord! while I live, in proof to earth</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My prayers are with Thee; that they rend the clouds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, rising through the sightless dark of space,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Reach to Thy central throne. Oh! let me feel,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What was my constant dream in my young years,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And is in all my better moments now⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My hope, my faith, my nature’s sum and end,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Oneness with Thee and Heaven. Lord! make me sure</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My soul already is in unison</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With the triumphant. Ah! I surely hear</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The voices of the spirits of the saints,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And witnesses to the Redeeming Truth;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not, as of old, in scanty scattered strains,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Breathed from the caves of earth and cells of cities⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor as the voice of martyr choked with fire⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But in one solemn Heaven-pervading hymn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of happiness impregnable, as when</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From the bright walls of the Son’s city they</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Looked on the war of Hell, host upon host,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Foiled by God’s single sword before their gates</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of perfect pearl;⁠—nearer and nearer now!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This is the sign, O God! which Thou hast given,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I will praise Thee through Eternity.</span>
