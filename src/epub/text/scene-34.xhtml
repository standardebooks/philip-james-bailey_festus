								<span>Hot from the fight I come. This lightning blade</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath holpen well to thin the infernal rout,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which back hath fled to hell, howling like winds.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But let me, at your will, ye peaceful saints,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Relate what happed to us from first to last.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The time was come in Heaven when God the Son,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bowing his head before the Omnipotent,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who doubled every blessing infinite</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wherewith he had enriched His Only One</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From first, rose from his glorious throne, and stepped</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into His sun-bright car, calling aloud</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His angels to attend Him while He went</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To judge the earth, as fore-ordained of old:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That Heaven and earth might view the majesty</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And mercy of the God of all. We came,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Selectest spirits, countless⁠—crowded bright</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As the great stream of stars which flows through Heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fast by the foot of God, each wave a world⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Eager to the eye this act of glory long</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Talked of in Heaven, and now to be achieved.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Forth from the starry towers, and world-wide walls,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Heaven, we set in high and silent joy,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And journeyed half our way through Heaven, when lo!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A sight which checked the foremost flaming ranks,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That halted frontwise, working doubt at first,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But triumph after. Shielded and drawn up close,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Behind a broken and decaying world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From which the light had vanished like the light</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of a death-shrunk eye, sat Lucifer⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Midst in the powers of darkness, and the hosts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of hell, enthroned sublime; and all were still</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As ambushed silence round the Foe of God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But oh! how changed from him we knew in Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose brightness nothing made might match nor mar;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who rose, and it was morn;⁠—who stretched his wing,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And stepped from star to star;⁠—so changed he showed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Most like a shadowy meteor, thorough which</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The stars dim glint⁠—woe-wasted, pined with pain.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And by his side there sat or shrank a shape</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We angels knew not, but the Son of God</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Knew him, and called him Death; whom, when he saw,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Arousing, after, out of sleep intense,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That unrealmed tyrant drew his mortal dart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And drave it through himself⁠—a shade, shade-quelled.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then to that chief of mischief and his fiends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who, thick as burning stones that from the throat</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of some volcano foul the benighted sky,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shot up triumphant into air as they</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beheld our ranks move on, thus spake our Lord⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not wrathfully, but sternly pitying:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hell’s wretched remnant! wherefore crouch ye here?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is it to sue destruction, or to bar</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My passage? If it be, in both ye err.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And will ye trust yourselves again to war</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With me Almighty? Have I not overcome</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye separately, both? Speak, brutal Death!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fit follower and fellow to all woes⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wherefore this instantaneous haste from hell,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And both from Hadeän bondage, thus again</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So soon to compass mightiest wickedness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And tempt extremest wrath? Speak, head of hell!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To Him thus Lucifer: Almighty Son!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy power I defy not; but in peace</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I war with fate. My life is to destroy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Evil hath more activity, if good</span>
								<br/>
								<span>More strength: and one must wear the other out.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The more august the sin, so much the more</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is my necessity. Yon earth hath been</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The battle-plain of Heaven and hell. From Thee,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who knowest all things, it were vain to hide</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My purpose, which for a thousand years, the years</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of bondage, hath grown in me and lived on,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Toad-like within a rock⁠—vital where all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beside was death⁠—to seize the nascent souls</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of men a they rerose from death to life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sweep them off in midst of all these hosts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Assembled for that cause here as Thou seest,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To hell;⁠—the universal race of man.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But if ordained that not on them, but Thee</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Thine, old hate shall satisfy itself,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Approach no nearer; for we live by death;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or turn the tide of fate, Thou sole who canst!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ceasing thereat, his host upraised a shout</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which shook the stars, and made them ring again.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our Lord to him then spake thus, mild as Spring,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Addressing earth when smiling she lets fall</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All flowerets from her lips⁠—’Tis well there is a God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lo! to what base extremes infernal pride</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can push a princely spirit once in Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thee we will not destroy now, for thine hour</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath yet to come⁠—when least thou thinkest it.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God’s wrath thou hast endured in punishment.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not yet His power. Away! I warn ye hence</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ere wrath ride forth again. To Him the Fiend</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Answered: God rules not us the unordered damned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor recks of hell. For ages past belief,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unless by those who like ourselves denied</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thine own eternity⁠—by creature mind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>However lofty, hardly compassed⁠—we</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have borne our pain without remorse, or sign</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of pity from our Maker. Shall we now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Believe, while thus confronting Him again,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He means us better? Never worse than now.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Therefore I say to ye, on! mightiest fiends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On! Let us reap companions for our woes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or earn annihilation! At the word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His fiery phalanx rushed to bar the way</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Him whose ways are over all His works.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A million spears blazed forth their answer bright,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As of as many tongues. Serene our ranks</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Stood as the stars o’er thunder. God the Son</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sat in His orbèd car, and breathed on them;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And they were rolled up like the desert sands</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Before the burning wind⁠—throne wrecked on throne,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All ruined and fordone. Pursue! He cried,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor let them near the earth I go to judge.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And we pursued, as many as He chose,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And chased from sphere to sphere that wretched wreck</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of falsest fiends:⁠—and I, it seems, am first</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of all my victor brethren to declare</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The triumph past and coming, and to cheer</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tour hearts with tidings of our Lord, to whom</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be glory for His universal deeds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And to him, only God!</span>
