								<span>Whom all the great and bright of spirit choose⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis I who breathe my soul into the lips</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of those great lights whom death nor time eclipse;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis I who wing the loving heart with song,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And set its sighs to music on the tongue:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is I who watch, and, with sweet dreams, reward</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The starry slumbers of the youthful bard;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For I love every thing that is sweet and bright.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And but this morn, with the first wink of light</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A sunbeam left the sun, and, as it sped,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I followed, watched, and listened what it said:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wherefore, with all this brightness am I given</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From sun to earth? Am I not fit for Heaven?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From God I came once; and, though worlds have passed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ages, and dooms, yet I am light to the last.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whatever God hath once bent to His will</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is sacred; so the world’s to be loved still.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What of this swift, this bright, but downward being,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Too burning to be borne⁠—too brief for seeing?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What is mine aim⁠—mine end? I would not die</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In dust, or water, or an idiots eye:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I would not cease in blood, nor end in fire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor light the loveless to their low desire:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No; let me perish on the poet’s page,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where he kisses from his beauty’s brow all age;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Spelling it fair for aye, and wrinkle scorning,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As when first that brow brake on him like a morning.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But yet I cannot quit this line I tread,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though it lead and leave me to the eyeless dead:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is mine errand: ’tis for this I come,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And live, and die, and go down to my doom.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This is my fate⁠—right and bright to speed on.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God is His own God: fate and fall are one.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Straight from the sun I go, like life from God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which hits, now on a heaven, now on a clod.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But, spite of all, the world’s air warps our way,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And crops the roses off the cheek of day;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As some false friend, who holds our fall in trust,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oils our decline, and hands us to the dust.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where are the sunbeams gone of the young green earth?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Search dust and night: our death makes dear our birth⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It said⁠—and saw earth; and one moment more</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fell bright beside a vine-shadowed cottage door:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In it came⁠—glanced upon a glowing page,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where, youth forestalling and foreshortening age⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Weak with the work of thought, a boyish bard,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sat suing night and stars for his reward.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sunbeam swerved and grew, a breathing, dim,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the first time, as it lit and looked on him:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His forehead faded⁠—pale his lip and dry⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hollow his cheek⁠—and fever fed his eye.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Clouds lay about his brain, as on a hill,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quick with the thunder thought, and lightning will.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His clenched hand shook from its more than midnight clasp,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till his pen fluttered like a winged asp,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Save that no deadly poison blacked its lips:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Twas his to life-enlighten, not eclipse;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor would he shade one atom of another,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To have a sun his slave, a god his brother.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The young moon laid her down as one who dies,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Knowing that death can be no sacrifice,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For that the sun, her god, through nature’s night</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall make her bosom to grow great with light.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Still he sat, though his lamp sunk; and he strained</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His eyes to work the nightness which remained.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Vain pain! he could not make the light he wanted,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And soon thought’s wizard ring gets disenchanted.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When earth was dayed⁠—was morrowed⁠—the first ray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Perched on his pen, and diamonded its way;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sunray that I watched; which, proud to mark</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The line it loved as deathless, there died dark⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Died in the only path it would have trod,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Were there as many ways as worlds to God⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There, in the eye of God again to burn,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As all man’s glory unto God’s must turn.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And so may sunbeams ever guide his pen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And God his heart, who lights the morn of men;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For this life is but Being’s first faint ray;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sun on sun, and heaven on heaven, make up God’s day.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And were there suns in day as stars in night,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They would show but like one ray from out His full-sphered light;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As but one momentary gleam would fly;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or, as years, the arrows of eternity.</span>

								<span>Poets are all who love⁠—who feel great thruths⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And tell them; and the truth of truths is love.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There was a time⁠—oh, I remember well!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When, like a sea-shell with its seaborn strain,</span>

								<span>My soul aye rang with music of the lyre;</span>

								<span>A honey dew, and throve on what it shed.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Imagination is the air of mind;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Judgment its earth, and memory its main;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Passion its fire. I was at home in Heaven;</span>

								<span>The meanest thing might master me: long wings</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But baffled. Still and still I harped on song.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! to create within the mind is bliss;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, shaping forth the lofty thought, or lovely,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We seek not, need not Heaven: and when the thought⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cloudy and shapeless, first forms on the mind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Slow darkening into, some gigantic make,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How the heart shakes with pride and fear, as heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quakes under its own thunder: or as might,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of old, the mortal mother of a god,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When first she saw him lessening up the skies.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And I began the toil divine of verse,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which like a burning-bush, doth guest a god.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But this was only wing-flapping⁠—not flight;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The pawing of the courser ere he win;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till, by degrees, from wrestling with my soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I gathered strength to keep the fleet thoughts fast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And made them bless me. Yes, there was a time</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When tomes of ancient song held eye and heart⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Were the sole lore I recked of: the great bards</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Greece, of Rome, and mine own master land,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And they who in the holy book are deathless⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men who have vulgarized sublimity,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And bought up truth for the nations; parted it,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As soldiers lotted once the garb of God⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men who have forged gods⁠—uttered⁠—made them pass:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In whose words, to be read with many a heaving</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the heart, is a power, like wind in rain⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sons of the sons of God, who, in olden days,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Did leave their passionless Heaven for earth and woman,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Brought an immortal to a mortal breast;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, like a rainbow clasping the sweet earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And melting in the covenant of love,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Left here a bright precipitate of soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which lives for ever through the lines of men,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Flashing, by fits, like fire from an enemy’s front⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose thoughts, like bars of sunshine in shut rooms,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mid gloom, all glory, win the world to light⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who make their very follies like their souls;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, like the young moon with a ragged edge,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Still, in their imperfection, beautiful⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose weaknesses are lovely as their strengths.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the white nebulous matter between stars,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which, if not lights at least is likest light⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men whom we build our love round like an arch</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of triumph, as they pass us on their way</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To glory and to immortality;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men whose great thoughts possess us like a passion</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Through every limb and the whole heart; whose words</span>

								<span>Haunt us as eagles haunt the mountain air;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thoughts which command all coming times and minds,</span>

								<span>As from a tower a warden⁠—fix themselves</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Deep in the heart as meteor stones in earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dropped from some higher sphere; the words of gods,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fragments of the undeemed tongues of Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men who walk up to fame as to a friend</span>

								<span>Men who, like Death, all bone, but all unarmed,</span>

								<span>And made him swear to maintain their name and fame</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At peril of his life⁠—who shed great thoughts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As easily as an oak looseneth its golden leaves</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a kindly largess to the soil it grew on⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose rich dark ivy thoughts, sunned o’er with love,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Flourish around the deathless stems of their names⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose names are ever on the world’s broad tongue,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like sound upon the falling of a force⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose words, if winged, are with angels’ wings⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who play upon the heart as on a harp,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And make our eyes bright as we speak of them⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose hearts have a look southwards, and are open</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To the whole noon of nature⁠—these I have waked</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And wept o’er, night by night; oft pondering thus:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Homer is gone; and where is Jove? and where</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The rival cities seven? His song outlives</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Time, tower, and god⁠—all that then was save Heaven.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>I live or die with thee, soul of my soul!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thou camest and went’st, sunlike, from morn to eve:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And smiledst fire upon my heaving heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the sun in the sea, tall it arose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And dashed about its house all might and mirth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like ocean’s tongue in Staffa’s stormy cave.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thou art a weakly reed to lean upon;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But, like that reed the false one filched from Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Full of immortal fire⁠—immortal as</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The breath of God’s lips⁠—every breath a soul.</span>
