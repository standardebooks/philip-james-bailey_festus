								<span>Declare unto thee that the past is not.</span>

								<span>I have looked over all life, yet never seen</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Plague not thyself about a future. That</span>

								<span>Only which comes direct from God, His spirit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is deathless. Nature gravitates without</span>

								<span>I would it were. This life’s a mystery.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The value of a thought cannot be told;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But it is clearly worth a thousand lives</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like many men’s. And yet men love to live</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As if mere life were worth their living for.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What but perdition will it be to most?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Life’s more than breath and the quick round of blood</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is a great spirit and a busy heart.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The coward and the small in soul scarce do live.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One generous feeling⁠—one great thought⁠—one deed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of good, ere night, would make life longer seem</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Than if each year might number a thousand days⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Spent as is this by nations of mankind.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In feelings, not in figures on a dial.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who thinks most⁠—feels the noblest⁠—acts the best</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Life’s but a means unto an end⁠—that end,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beginning, mean and end to all things⁠—God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The dead have all the glory of the world.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why will we live and not be glorious?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We never can be deathless till we die.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is the dead win battles. And the breath</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of those who through the world drive like a wedge,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tearing earth’s empires up, nears death so close</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It dims his well-worn scythe. But no? the brave</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Die never. Being deathless, they but change</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their country’s arms for more⁠—their country’s heart.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Give then the dead their due; it is they who saved us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The rapid and the deep⁠—the fall, the gulf</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have likenesses in feeling and in life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And life, so varied, hath more loveliness</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In one day than a creeping century</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of sameness. But youth loves and lives on change</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till the soul sighs for sameness; which at last</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Becomes variety, and takes its place.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet some will last to die out thought by thought,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And power by power, and limb of mind by limb,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like lambs upon a gay device of glass,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till all of soul that’s left be dry and dark;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till even the burden of some ninety years</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath crashed into them like a rock; shattered</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their system as if ninety suns had rushed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To ruin earth⁠—or Heaven had rained its stars;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till they become, like scrolls, unreadable</span>

								<span>Then I will not tell ye. You shall wait until</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some angel come and stir your stagnant souls:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then plunge into yourselves and rise redeemed.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Come, I’ll unroll your hearts and read them to ye.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To say ye live is but to say ye have souls,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That ye have paid for them and mean to play them,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till some brave pleasure wins the golden stake,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And rakes it up to death as to a bank.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye live and die on what your souls will fetch;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all are of different prices: therefore Hell</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cannot well bargain for mankind in gross;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But each soul must be purchased, one by one.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This it is makes men rate themselves so high:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While truly ye are worth little: but to God</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye are worth more than to yourselves. By sin</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye wreak your spite against God⁠—that ye know:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And knowing, will it. But I pray, I beg,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Act with some smack of justice to your Maker,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If not unto yourselves. Do! It is enough</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To make the very Devil chide mankind⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such baseness, such unthankfulness! Why he</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thanks God he is no worse. You don’t do that.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I say be just to God. Leave off these airs</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Know your place⁠—speak to God⁠—and say, for once,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Go first, Lord! Take your finger off your eye!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It blocks the universe and God from sight.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Think ye your souls are worth nothing to God?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are they so small? What can be great with God?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What will ye weigh against the Lord? Yourselves?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bring out your balance: get in, man by man:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Add earth, heaven, hell, the universe; that’s all.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God puts his finger in the other scale,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And up we bounce, a bubble. Nought is great</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor small with God⁠—for none but He can make</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The atom indivisible, and none</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But He can make a world: He counts the orbs,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He counts the atoms of the universe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And makes both equal⁠—both are infinite.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Giving God honor, never underrate</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yourselves: after Him ye are everything</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But mind! God’s more than everything; He is God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And what of me? No, us? no! I mean the Devil?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why see ye not he goes before both you</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And God? Men say⁠—as proud as Lucifer⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pray who would not be proud with such a train?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath he not all the honor of the earth?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why Mammon sits before a million hearths</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where God is bolted out from every house.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Well might He say He cometh as a thief;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For He will break your bars and burst your doors</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which slammed against Him once, and turn ye out</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Roofless and shivering, ’neath the doom-storm; Heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall crack above ye like a bell in fire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And bury all beneath its shining shards.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He calls: ye hear not. Lo! he comes⁠—ye see not.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No; ye are deaf as a dead adder’s ear:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No; ye are blind as never bat was blind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With a burning bloodshot blindness of the heart;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A swimming, swollen senselessness of soul.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Listen! Whom love ye most? Why him to whom</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye in your turn are dearest. Need I name?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh no! But all are devils to themselves;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And every man his own great foe. Hell gets</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Only the gleanings; earth hath the full wain;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And hell is merry at its harvest home.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But ye are generous to sin and grudge</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The gleaners nothing; ask them, push them in.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let not an ear, a grain of sin be lost;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gather it, grind it up; it is our bread:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We should be ashamed to waste the gifts of God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why is the world so mad? Why runs it thus</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Having and howling round the universe?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Because the Devil bit it from the birth!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fault is all with him. Fear nothing, friends!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is fear which beds the far to-come with fire</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As the sun does the west: but the sun sets;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Well; still ye tremble⁠—tremble, first at light,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then darkness. Tremble! ye dare not believe.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No, cowards! sooner than believe ye would die;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Die with the black lie flapping on your lips</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the soot-flake upon a burning bar.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be merry, happy if ye can: think never</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of him who slays your souls, nor Him who saves.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is, time enough for that when ye are a-dying.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Keep your old ways! It matters not this once.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be brave! Ye are not men whom meat and wine</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Serve to remind but of the sacrament;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To whom sweet shapes, and tantalizing smiles</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bring up the Devil and the ten commandments⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And so on⁠—but I said the world must end.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I am sorry; it is such a pleasant world:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With all it faults it is perfect⁠—to a fault:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And you, of course, end with it. Now how long</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will the world take to die? I know ye place</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Great faith upon death-bed repentances;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The saddener the better. I know ye often</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Begin to think of praying and repenting;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But second thoughts come and ye are worse than ever;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As over new white snow a filthy thaw.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye do amaze me verily. How long</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will ye take heart on your own wickedness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And God’s forbearance? Have ye cast it up?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Come now; the year and month, day, hour and minute,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sin’s golden cycle. Do ye know how long</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Exactly Heaven will grant ye? how long God⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who when he had slain the world and wasted it,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hung up His bow in Heaven, as in his hall</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A warrior after battle⁠—will yet bear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tour contumely and scorn of His best gifts⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Man’s mockery of man? But never mind!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some of us are magnificently good,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And hold the head up high like a giraffe;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>You, in particular, and you⁠—and you.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Good men are here and there, I know; but then⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>You must excuse me if I mention this⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My duty is to tell it you⁠—the world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like a black block of marble, jagged with white,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As with a vein of lightning petrified,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Looks blacker than without such; looks in truth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So gross the heathen, gross the Christian too⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the original darkness of void space,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hardened. Instead of justice, love and grace,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each worth to man the mission of a God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Injustice, hate, uncharitableness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Triequal reign round earth, a Trinity of Hell.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye think ye never can be bad enough:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And as ye sink in sin, ye rise in hope.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And let the worst come to the worst, you say,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There always will be time to turn ourselves,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And cry for half an hour or so to God:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Salvation, sure, is not so very hard⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It need not take one long; and half an hour</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is quite as much as we can spare for it.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We have no time for pleasures. Business! business!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No! ye she perish sudden and unsaved.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The priest shall, dipping, die. Can man save man?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is water God? The counsellor, wise fool!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Drop down amid his quirks and sacred lies⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The judge, while dooming unto death some wretch,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall meet at once his own death, doom, and judge.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The doctor, watch in hand, and patient’s pulse,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall feel his own heart cease its beats⁠—and fall:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Professors shall spin out, and students strain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their brains no more; art, science, toil shall cease.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world shall stand still with a rending jar,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As though it struck at sea. The halls where sit</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The heads of nations shall be dumb with death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The ship shall after her own plummet sink,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sound the sea herself and depths, of death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At the first turn Death shall cut off the thief,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And dash the gold bag in his yellow brain.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The gambler, reckoning gains, shall drop a piece;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Stoop down and there see death;⁠—look up, there God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The wanton, temporizing with decay,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And qualifying every line which vice</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Writes bluntly on the brow, inviting scorn,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall pale through plastered red: and the loose, low sot</span>
								<br/>
								<span>See clear, for once, through his misty, o’erbrimmed eye.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The just, if there be any, die in prayer.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Death shall be every where among your marts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And giving bills which no man may decline⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Drafts upon Hell one moment after date.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then shall your outcries tremble amid the stars:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Terrors shall be about ye like a wind:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fears come down upon ye like a house.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>The bondage of religious bigotry,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And bald antiquity, servility</span>

								<span>Of thought or speech to rank and power; be all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Free as they ought to be in mind and soul</span>

								<span>That all may have enough, and some safe mean</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of worldly goods and honours, by degrees,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Take place, if practicable, in the fitness</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fullness of Thy time. And we beseech Thee,</span>

								<span>Nor faith be circumscribed, which as to Thee,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Of all kinds from Thy church, and all temptation</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of pomp or power political, that none</span>
								<br/>

								<span>To any of its orders, low or high;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And no ambition, of a worldly cast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Leaven the love of souls unto whose care</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They feel propelled by Thy most holy spirit.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be every church established, Lord! in truth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let all who preach the word, live by the word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In moderate estate; and in Thy church⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One, universal, and invisible</span>
								<br/>
								<span>World-wards, yet manifest unto itself,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May it seem good, dear Saviour, in Thy sight,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That orders be distinguished, not by wealth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But piety and power of teaching souls.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Equalise labour, Lord! and recompence.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let not a hundred humble pastors starve,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In this or any land of Christendom,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While one or two, impalaced, mitred, throned</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And banqueted, burlesque if not blaspheme</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The holy penury of the Son of God;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fastings, the footwanderings, and the preachings</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Christ and His first followers. Oh that the Son</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Might come again! There should be no more war,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No more want, no more sickness; with a touch,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He should cure all disease, and with a word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All sin; and with a look to Heaven, a prayer,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Provide bread for a million at a time.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But till that perfect advent grant us, Lord!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That all good institutions, orders, claims,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Charitably proposed, or in the aid</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Thy divine foundation, may much prosper,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And more of them be raised and nobly filled;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That Thy word may be taught throughout all lands,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And save souls daily to the thrones of Heaven!⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And we entreat Thee, that all men whom Thou</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hast gifted with great minds may love Thee well,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And praise Thee for their powers, and use them most</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Humbly and holily, and, lever-like,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Act but in lifting up the mass of mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>About them; knowing well that they shall be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Questioned by Thee of deeds the pen hath done,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or caused, or glozed; inspire them with delight</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And power to treat of noble themes and things,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Worthily, and to leave the low and mean⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Things born of vice or day-lived fashion, in</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their naked native folly:⁠—make them know</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fine thoughts are wealth, for the right use of which</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men are and ought to be accountable⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If not to Thee, to those they influence:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Grant this we pray Thee, and that all who read,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or utter noble thoughts, may make them theirs,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And thank God for them, to the betterment</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of their succeeding life;⁠—that all who lead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The general sense and taste, too apt, perchance,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To be led, keep in mind the mighty good</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They may achieve, and are in conscience, bound,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And duty, to attempt unceasingly</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To compass. Grant us, All-maintaining Sire!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That all the great mechanic aids to toil</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Man’s skill hath formed, found, rendered⁠—whether used</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In multiplying works of mind, or aught</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To obviate the thousand wants of life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May much avail to human welfare now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in all ages, henceforth and for ever!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let their effect be, Lord! to lighten labour,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And give more room to mind, and leave the poor</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some time for self-improvement. Let them not</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be forced to grind the bones out of their arms</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For bread, but have some space to think and feel</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like moral and immortal creatures. God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have mercy on them till such time shall come;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Look Thou with pity on all lesser crimes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thrust on men almost when devoured by want,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wretchedness, ignorance and outcast life!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have mercy on the rich, too, who pass by</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The means they have at hand to fill their minds</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With serviceable knowledge for themselves,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fellows, and support not the good cause</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the world’s better future! Oh, reward</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All such who do, with peace of heart and power</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For greater good. Have mercy, Lord! on each</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all, for all men need it equally.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May peace and industry and commerce weld</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into one land all nations of the world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rewedding those the Deluge once divorced.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! may all help each other in good things,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mentally, morally, and bodily!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Vouchsafe, kind God! Thy blessing to this isle,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Specially! May our country ever lead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world, for she is worthiest; and may all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Profit by her example, and adopt</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Her course, wherever great, or free, or just.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May all her subject colonies and powers</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have of her freedom freely, as a child</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Receiveth of its parents. Let not rights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be wrested from us to our own reproach,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But granted. We may make the whole world free,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And be as free ourselves as ever, more!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If policy or self-defence call forth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our forces to the field, let us in Thee</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Place, first, our trust, and in Thy name we shall</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’ercome, for we will only wage the right.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let us not conquer nations for ourselves,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But for Thee, Lord! who hast predestined us</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To fight the battles of the future now,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And so have done with war before Thou comest.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till then, Lord God of armies, let our foes</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have their swords broken and their cannon burst,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And their strong cities levelled; and while we</span>
								<br/>
								<span>War faithfully and righteously, improve,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Civilize, christianize the lands we win</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From savage or from nature, Thou, oh God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wilt aid and hallow conquest, as of old,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thine own immediate nation’s. But we pray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That all mankind may make one brotherhood,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And love and serve each other; that all wars</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And feuds die out of nations, whether those</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom the sun’s hot light darkens, or ourselves</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom he treats fairly, or the northern tribes</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom ceaseless snows and starry winters blench,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Savage or civilized⁠—let every race,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bed, black or white, olive, or tawny-skinned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Settle in peace and swell the gathering hosts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the great Prince of Peace! Oh! may the hour</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Soon come when all false gods, false creeds, false prophets⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Allowed in Thy good purpose for a time⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Demolished, the great world shall be at last,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The mercy-seat of God, the heritage</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Christ, and the possession of the Spirit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The comforter, the wisdom! shall all be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One land, one home, one friend, one faith, one law,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its ruler God, its practice righteousness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its life peace! For the one true faith we pray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is but one in Heaven and there shall be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But one on earth, the same which is in Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Prophecy is more true than history.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Grant us our prayers, we pray, Lord! in the name</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And for the sake of Thy Son Jesus Christ,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our Saviour and Redeemer, who with Thee,</span>
