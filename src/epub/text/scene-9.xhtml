								<span>Blind as the blue skies after sunset. Blind!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And I am tired of looking on what is.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One might as well see beauty never more,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As look upon it with an empty eye.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I would this, world were over. I am tired.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nought happens but what happens to one’s self;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all hath happened I have wished, and more.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our pleasures all pass from us, one by one,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With that relief which sighing gives the heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though each sigh leaves it lower. It is sad</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To think how few our pleasures really are:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And for the which we risk eternal good.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There’s nothing that can satisfy one’s self,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Except one’s self. Well, it is very sad,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And by the time we come of age we have felt</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In one degree or other all that age</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can offer. We have reaped our field ere noon.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The rest is reproduction; sowing⁠—reaping⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Losing again. Toil and gain tire alike.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We cannot live too slowly to be good</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And happy, nor too much by line and square.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But youth is burning to forestall its nature,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And will not wait for time to ferry it</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Over the stream, but flings itself into</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The flood, and perishes. And yet, why not?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is no charm in time as time, nor good.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The long days are no happier than the short ones.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis sometime now since I was here. We leave</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our home in youth⁠—no matter to what end;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Study⁠—or strife⁠—or pleasure, or what not:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And coming back in few short years, we find</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All as we left it, outside; the old elms,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The house, grass, gates, and latchet’s selfsame click:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But lift that latchet⁠—all is changed as doom:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The servants have forgotten our step, and more</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Than half of those who knew us know us not.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Adversity, prosperity, the grave,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Play a round game With friends. On some the world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath shot its evil eye, and they are passed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From honour and remembrance, and a stare</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is all the mention of their names receives;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And people know no more of them than of</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The shapes of clouds at midnight, a year back.</span>

								<span>As if it ate itself, and moralled time.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world is like yon children’s merry-go-round;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What men admire are carriages and hobbies,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which the exalted manikins enjoy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is a noisy ragged crowd below</span>

								<span>The excitement for their pains⁠—best gain perhaps:</span>

								<br/>
								<span>It is wretchedness or recklessness alone</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Keeps us alive. Were we happy we should die.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet what is death? I like to think on death:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is but the appearance of an apparition.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One ought to tremble; but oughts stand for nothing.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I hate the thought of wrinkling up to rest;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The toothlike aching ruin of the body,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With the heart all out, and nothing left but edge.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Give me the long high bounding feel of life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which cries, let me but leap unto my grave,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And I’ll not mind the when nor where. We never</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Care less for life than when enjoying it.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! I should love to die. What is to die?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I cannot hold the meaning more than can</span>
								<br/>
								<span>An oak’s arms clasp the blast that blows on it.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is an air-like something which must be.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And yet not to be seen, nor to be touched.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I am made up to die; for having been</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Every thing, there is nothing left but nothing</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To be again.</span>

									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>My fortune was her own.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou art but yet a boy, she said,</span>

									<span>I am a man in love, I cried;</span>

									<br/>
									<span>And then let go my hand.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We stood a minute: neither spake</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What each must understand.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I told her, so she would be mine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And follow where I went,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She straight should have a bridal bower</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Instead of gipsy tent.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Or would she have me wend with her,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The world between should fall;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For her I would fling up faith and friends,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And name, and fame, and all.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Her smile so bright froze while I spake,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And ice was in her eye;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So near, it seemed ere touch her heart</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I might have kissed the sky.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I said that if she loved to rule,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or if she longed to reign,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I would make her Queen of every race</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which tearhke trode the world’s sad face,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or bleed at every vein.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>She laid her finger on her lip,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And pointed to the sky;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There is no God to come, she said:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dost thou not fear to die?</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And what is God, I said, to thee?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thy people worship not.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The good, the happy, and the free,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She said, they need no God.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I looked until I lost mine eyes;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I felt as though I were</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In a dark cave, with one weak light⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The light of life⁠—with her;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And that was wasting fast away;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I watched but would not stir.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Again she took my hand in hers,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And read it o’er and o’er;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah! eyes so young, so sweet, I said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Make as they read love’s lore.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>She held my hand⁠—I trembled whilst⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For sorely soon I felt</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She made the love-cross she foretold</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And all the woe she dealt.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Unhappy I should be she said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And young to death be given;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I told her I believed in her,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not in the stars of Heaven.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Hush! we breathe Heaven, she said, and bowed;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the stars speak through me.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Let Heaven, I cried, take care of Heaven!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I only care for thee.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>She shrank: I looked, and begged a kiss:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I knew she had one for me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She would deny me none, she said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But give me none would she.</span>
								</p>
								<p>

									<br/>
									<span>’Tis three long years like this,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Since there I gave and got from thee</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That meeting, parting kiss.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I saw the tears start in her eye,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And trickle down her cheek,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like falling stars across the sky,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Escaping from their Maker’s eye:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw, but spared to speak.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Go, and forget! she said, and slid</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Below her lowly tent.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I will not, cannot⁠—hear me, girl!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She heard not, and I went.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>At eve, by sunset, I was there,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The tent was there no more;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The fire which warmed her flickered still⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The fire she sat before.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I stood by it, till through the dark</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw not where it lay;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And then like that my heart went out</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In ashy grief and gray.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>My gipsy maid! my gipsy maid!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Oh! let me bless this day;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This day it was I met thee first,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And yet it shall be and is cursed,</span>

								<span>Day house on high, the moon’s dim detriment,</span>

								<span>Mistlike, the shining bath where Luna laves,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Yea, the beginning and the end of Death,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>And which is nature only, wholly, still</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In Heavenly gloom incomprehensible</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wait the Deific will; yea, still the light</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whereto all elements contribute, burns</span>
								<br/>
								<span>About us and within us, world and soul;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The primal sperm and matter of the world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose centre is the limit of all things⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The snowy gold, the star and spirit seed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which is to render rich and deathless all⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The self-begot, self-wedded, and self-born,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which the wind carries in its womb, all have,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And few receive; the spirit of the earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The water of immortal life still lives:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The universal solvent of disease</span>

								<span>Which came between them and their hearts’ delight.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>None but the brave and beautiful can love.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh, for the young heart like a fountain playing!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Flinging its bright fresh feelings up to the skies</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It loves and strives to reach⁠—strives, loves in vain:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is of earth, and never meant for Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let us love both, and die. The sphinx-like heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Consistent in its inconsistency,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Loathes life the moment that life’s riddle is read:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The knot of our existence is untied,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And we lie loose and useless. Life is had;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then we sigh, and say, can this be all?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is not what we thought⁠—it is very well⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But we want something more⁠—there is but death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And when we have said, and seen, and done, and had,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Enjoyed and suffered, all we have wished and feared⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From fame to ruin, and from love to loathing⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There can come but one more change⁠—try it⁠—death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! it is great to feel we care for nothing⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That hope, nor love, nor fear, nor aught of earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can check the royal lavishment of life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But like a streamer strown upon the wind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We fling our souls to fate and to the future.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And to die young is youth’s divinest gift⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To pass from one world fresh into another,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ere change hath lost the charm of soft regret,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And feel the immortal impulse from within</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which makes the coming, life⁠—cry, alway, on!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And follow it while strong⁠—is Heaven’s last mercy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is a fire-fly in the southern clime</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which shineth only when upon the wing;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So is it with the mind: when once we rest,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We darken. On! said God unto the soul</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As to the earth, for ever. On it goes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A rejoicing native of the infinite⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As a bird of air⁠—an orb of heaven.</span>
