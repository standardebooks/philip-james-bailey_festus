								<span>Have but one cause, and that the same⁠—God’s will,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Originally, ultimately Him.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All right is right divine. A worm hath rights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A king cannot despoil him of, nor sin;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet wrongs are things necessitate, like wants,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And oft are well permitted to best ends.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A double error sometimes sets us right.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In man there is no rule o£ right and wrong</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Inherent as mere man. Why, conscience is</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The basest thing of all. Its life is passed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In justifying and condemning sin;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Accomplice, traitor, judge and headsman, too,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But conscience knows its business and performs.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nothing is lost in nature; and no soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though buried in the centre of all sin,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is lost to God; but there it works His will</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And burns comformably. The weakest things</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are to be made the examples of His might;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The most defective, of His perfect grace,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whene’er He thinketh well. Oh! everything</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To me seems good and lovely and immortal;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The whole is beautiful; and I can see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nought wrong in man nor nature, nought not meant;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As from His hands it comes who fashions all,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All holy as His word. The world is but</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A revelation. He breathes Himself upon us</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Before our birth, as o’er the formless void</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He moveth at first, and we are all inspired</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With His spirit. All things are God or of God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the whole world is in the mind of God</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What a thought is in ours. Why boast we then</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of aught? All that is good belongs to God;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And good and God are all things, or shall be.</span>
