								<span>As is the oracle of an extinct god</span>

								<span>Violet, rose or pearl-hued, or soft blue,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Golden or green, the light now blended, now</span>

								<span>Crescent, or gibbous-faced, illumining</span>

								<br/>
								<span>The different states of spirits and the kinds</span>

								<span>Preferring questions, but at each response</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My soul drew back, sealike, into its depths</span>

								<span>To urge another charge on him. This spirit</span>

								<span>Came to me daily for a long, long time,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>He knew right well which man’s eye never yet</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath marked, nor ever may mark while on earth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet grew his knowledge every time he came.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His thoughts all great and solemn and serene,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the immensest features of an orb,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose eyes are blue seas, and whose clear broad brow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some cultured continent, came ever round</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From truth to truth⁠—day bringing as they came.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He was to me an all-explaining spirit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Teaching divine things by analogy</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With mortal and material. Thus of God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He showed, as the three primal rays make one</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sole beam of Light, so the three Persons make</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One God; neither without the other is.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>However bright or beautiful itself</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The theme he touched, he made it more so by</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His own light, like a fire-fly on a flower.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And one of all I knew the most of, yet</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The least can say of him; for full oft</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our thoughts drown speech, like to a foaming force,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which thunders down the echo it creates.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet must I somewhat tell of him. He was</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The spirit evil of the universe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Impersonate. Oh, strange and wild to know!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Perdition and destruction dwelt in him,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to a pair of eagles in one nest.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hollow and wasteful as a whirlwind was</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His soul; his heart as earthquake, and engulphed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>World upon world. In him they disappeared</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As might a morsel in a lion’s maw,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world which met him rolled aside to let him</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pass on his piercing path. His eyeballs burned</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Revolving lightnings like a world on fire;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their very night was fatal as the shade</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Death’s dark valley. And his space-spread wings⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wide as the wings of Darkness when she rose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Scowling, and backing upwards, as the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Giant of Light, first donned his burning crown,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gladdening all Heaven with bis inaugural smile⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Were stained with the blood of many a starry world:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yea, I have seen him seize upon an orb,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And cast it careless into worldless space,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As I might cast a pebble in the sea.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His might upon Ibis earth was wondrous most.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He stood a match for mountains. Ocean’s depths</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He clove unto their rock-bed, as a sword,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Through blood and muscle to the central bone,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With one swoop of his arm. His brow was pale⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pale as the life-blood of the undying worm</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which writhes around its frame of vital fire.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His voice blew like the desolating gust</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which strips the trees, and strews the earth with death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His words were ever like a wheel of fire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rolling and burning this way now, now that:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now whirling forth a blinding beam, now soft</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And deep as Heaven’s own luminous blue⁠—and now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to a oonqueror’s chariot wheel they came,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sodden with blood and slow, revolving death:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And every tone fell on the ear and heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Heavy and harsh and startling, like the first</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Handful of mould cast on the coffined dead,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As though he claimed them his.</span>

								<span>’Twas on a lovely summer afternoon,</span>

								<span>Close by the grassy marge of a deep tarn,</span>

								<span>Nigh halfway up a mountain, that we stood,</span>

								<span>I and the angel, when she told me this.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Above us rose the grey rocks, by our side</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Forests of pines, and the bright breaking wavelets</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Came crowding, dancing to the brink, like thoughts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unto our lips. Before us shone the sun.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The angel waved her hand ere she began,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As bidding earth be still. The birds ceased singing</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the trees breathing, and the lake smoothed down</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each shining wrinkle and the wind drew off.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Time leant him o’er his scythe and, listening, wept.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The circling world reined in her lightning pace</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A moment; Ocean hushed his snow-maned steeds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And a cloud hid the sun, as does the face</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A meditative hand: then spake she thus:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Scarce had the sweet song of the morning stars,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which rang through space at the first sign of life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our earth gave, springing from the lap of God</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On to her orbit, when from Heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Came down a white-winged host; and in the east,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where Eden’s Pleasance was, first furled their wings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Alighting like to snowflakes. There they built,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of the riches of the soil around,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A house to God. There were the ruby rocks,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And there, in blocks, the quarried diamonds lay;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Opal and emerald mountain, amethyst,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sapphire and chrysoprase, and jacinth stood</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With the still action of a star, all light,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like sea-based icebergs, blinding. These, with tools</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tempered in Heaven, the band angelic wrought,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And raised, and fitted, having first laid down</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The deep foundations of the holy dome</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On bright and beaten gold; and all the while</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A song of glory hovered round the work</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like rainbow round a fountain. Day and night</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Went on the hallowed labor till ’twas done.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And yet but thrice the sun set, and but thrice</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The moon arose; so quick is work divine.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tower, and roof, and pinnacle, without,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Were solid diamond. Within, the dome</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was eyeblue sapphire, sown with gold-bright stars</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And clustering constellations; the wide floor</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All emerald, earthlike, veined with gold and silver,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Marble and mineral of every hue</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And marvellous quality, the meanest thing,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where all things were magnificent, was gold⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The plainest. The high altar there was shaped</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of one ruby heartlike. Columned round</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With alabaster pure was all. And now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So high and bright it shone in the midday light,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It could be seen from Heaven. Upon their thrones</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sun-eyed angels hailed it, and there rose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A hurricane of blissfulness in Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which echoed for a thousand years. One dark,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One solitary and foreseeing thought,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Passed, like a planet’s transit o’er the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Across the brow of God; but soon he smiled</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Towards earth, and that smile did consecrate</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The temple to Himself. And they who built</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bowed themselves down and worshipped in its walls.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>High on the front were writ these words⁠—to God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The heavenly built this for the earthly ones,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That in his worship both might mix on earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As afterward they hoped to do in Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Had man stood good in £den this had been:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He fell and Eden vanished. The bright place</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Reared by the angels of all precious things,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the joint worship of the sons of earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Heaven, fell with him, on the very day</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He should have met God and His angels there⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The very day he disobeyed and joined</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The host of death blackbannered, Eden fell;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The groves and grounds, which God the Lord’s own feet</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Had hallowed; the all-hued and odorous bowers</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where angels wandered, wishing them in Heaven;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The trees of life and knowledge⁠—trees of death</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And madness, as they proved to man⁠—all fell;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that bright fane fell first. No death-doomed eye</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gazed on its glory. Earthquakes gulped it down.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Temple of the Angels, vast enough</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To hold air nations worshipping at once,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lay in its grave; the cherubs’ flaming swords</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sole sad torches of its funeral.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till at the flood, when the world’s giant heart</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Burst like a shell, it scattered east and west,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And far and wide, among less noble ruins,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fragments of that angel-builded fane,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which was in Eden, and of which all stones</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That now are precious, were; and still shall be,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gathered again unto a happier end,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In the pure City of the Son of God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And temple yet to be rebuilt in Zion;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which, though once overthrown, and once again</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Torn down to its foundations, in the quick</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of earth, shall soul-like yet re-rise from ruin⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>High, holy, happy, stainless as a star,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Imperishable as eternity.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>—The angel ended; and the winds, waves, clouds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sun, the woods, and merry birds went on</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As theretofore, in brightness, strength and music.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One scarce could think that earth at all had fallen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To look upon her beauty. If the brand</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of sin were on her brow, it was surely hid</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In natural art from every eye but God’s.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All things seemed innocence and happiness.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I was all thanks. And look! the angel said,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Take these, and give to one thou lovest best:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mine own hands saved from them the shining ruin</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whereof I have late told thee; and she gave</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What now are greenly glowing on thine arms.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ere I could answer, she was up, star-high!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Winging her way through Heaven.</span>
