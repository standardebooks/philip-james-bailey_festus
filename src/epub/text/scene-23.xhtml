								<br/>
								<span>Worlds have been built, and to their central base</span>

								<span>Each drop its individual vein; the foam-bubble,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sun-drawn out of the sea into the clouds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To scale the cataract down which it fell,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or seek its primal source in earth’s hot heart;</span>
								<br/>
