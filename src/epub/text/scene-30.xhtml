									<br/>
									<span>Kings! ye are Kings no longer. Cast your crowns</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Here⁠—for my footstool. Every power is mine.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nobles! be first in honour. Ye, too, lose</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Your place, in place: retrieve yourselves, in good.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Peoples! be mighty in obedience.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Let each one labour for the common weal.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Be every man a people in his mind.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Kings⁠—nobles⁠—nations! love me and obey.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I need no aid⁠—no arms. Burn books⁠—break swords!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The world shall rest, and moss itself with peace.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Stand forth, and speak, sole servant of my throne!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If aught thou hast to settle and explain⁠—</span>
									<br/>

								<br/>
								<span>Now east⁠—now west. Your hour and power is past.</span>

								<span>His is the kingdom of the world and glory.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His throne is founded centre-deep by Heaven;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the whole earth doth bless him. Unto all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He hath laid out one perfect level law⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His will. For as the people cannot rule</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Themselves, so neither may a crowd of kings:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And hence hath been the evil of the earth⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now ceased for ever. War will be no more.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His is the sway of social sovereign peace:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His tyranny is love and good to all:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His is the vice-royed, vouched-safe sway of God:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And he will turn the world, at will; as light</span>
