								<span>This is to be a mortal and immortal!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To live within a circle⁠—and to be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That dark point where the shades of all things around</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Meet, mix and deepen. All things unto me</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Show their dark sides! somewhere there must be light.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! I feel like a seed in the cold earth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quickening at heart, and pining for the air!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Passion is destiny. The heart is its own</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fate. It is well youth’s gold rubs off so soon.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The heart gets dizzy with its drunken dance,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the voluptuous vanities of life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Enchain, enchant, and cheat my soul no more.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My spirit is on edge. I can enjoy</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nought which has not the honied sting of sin;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That soothing fret which makes the young untried,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Longing to be beforehand with their nature,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In dreams and loneness cry, they die to live;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That wanton whetting of the soul, which while</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It gives a finer, keener edge for pleasure,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wastes more and dulls the sooner. Rouse thee, heart;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bow of my life thou yet art full of spring!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My quiver still hath many purposes.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet what is worth a thought of all things here?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How mean, how miserable every care!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How doubtful, too, the system of the mind!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then the ceaseless, changeless, hopeless round</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of weariness and heartlessness and woe</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And vice and vanity! Yet these make life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The life at least I witness if not feel.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No matter! we are immortal. How I wish</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I could love men! for amid all life’s quests</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There seems but worthy one⁠—to do men good.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It matters not how long we live but how.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For as the parts of one manhood while here</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We live in every age: we think and feel</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And feed upon the coming and the gone</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As much as on the now time. Man is one:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And he hath one great heart. It is thus we feel,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With a gigantic throb athwart the sea,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each others’ rights and wrongs; thus are we men.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let us think less of men and more of God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sometimes the thought comes swiftening over us,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like a small bird winging the still blue air;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then again, at other times, it rises</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Slow, like a cloud which scales the skies all breathless,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And just over head lets itself down on us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sometimes we feel the wish across the mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rush, like a rocket tearing up the sky,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That we should join with God and give the world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The slip: but while we wish, the world turns round,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And peeps us in the face⁠—the wanton world;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We feel it gently pressing down our arm⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The arm we had raised to do for truth such wonders;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We feel it softly bearing on our side⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We feel it touch and thrill us through the body⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And we are fools and there’s an end of us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis a fine thought that sometime end we must.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There sets the sun of suns! dies in all fire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like Asher’s death-great monarch. God of might!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We love and live on power. It is spirit’s end.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mind must subdue. To conquer is its life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why mad’st Thou not one spirit, like the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To king the world? And oh! might I have been</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That sun-mind, how I would have warmed the world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To love and worship and bright life!</span>

								<span>Oh! I was glad when something in me said</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Come, let us worship beauty! and I bowed;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And went about to find a shrine; but found</span>
								<br/>
								<span>None that my soul, when seeing, said enough, to.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Many I met with where I put up prayers,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And had them more than answered; and at such</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I worshipped, partly because others did;</span>

								<br/>
								<span>I went champing and choking in proud pain;</span>

								<br/>
								<span>So I betook me to the sounding sea;</span>

								<span>Of a revenge on man; whereat almost</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I gladdened, for I felt savage as the sea.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I had only one thing to behold, the sea;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I had only one thing to believe, I loved;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Until that lonesome sameness grew sublime</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And darkly beautiful as death, when some</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bright soul regains its star-home, or as Heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Just when the stars falter forth, one by one,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the first words of love from a maiden’s lips.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There are points from which we can command our life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When the soul sweeps the future like a glass;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And coming things, full freighted with our fate,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Jut out, dark, on the offing of the mind.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let them come! Many will go down in sight;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In the billow’s joyous dash of death go down.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At last came love; not whence I sought nor thought it;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As on a ruined and bewildered wight</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rises the roof he meant to have lost for ever.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On came the living vessel of all love;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Terrible in its beauty as a serpent,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rode down upon me like a ship full sail</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And bearing me before it, kept me up</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Spite of the drowning speed at which we drave</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On, on, until we sank both. Was not this love?</span>
