									<span>Where is thy grave, my love?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I want to weep.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>High as thou art this earth above,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My woe is deep;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And my heart is cold as is thy grave,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where I can neither soothe nor save.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whate’er I say, or do, or see,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I think and feel alone to thee.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Oh! can it⁠—can it be forgiven,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That I forget thou art in Heaven?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou wilt forgive me this, and more:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Love spends his all, and still hath store.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou wilt forgive, if beauty’s wile</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Should win, perforce, one glance from me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When they, whose art it is to smile,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Can never smile my heart from thee;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And if with them I chance to be,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And give mine ear up to their singing,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It, wind-like, only wakes the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In all its mad monotony,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of memory forth thy music ringing.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou wilt forgive, if now and then</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I link with hands less loved than thine;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whose gold-like touch makes kings of men,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But wakes no will in blood of mine;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And if with them I toss the wine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And set my soul in love’s ripe riot,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It echoes not⁠—this desert shrine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where still thy love from Heaven doth shine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Moon-like, across some ruin’s quiet.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou wilt forgive me, if my feet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Should move to music with the fair;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When, at each turn, I burn to meet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thy stream-like step and aëry air;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And if, before some beauty there,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Mine eye may forge one glance of gladness,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It is but the ripple of despair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That shows the bed is all but bare,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And nought scarce left but stony sadness.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou wilt forgive, if e’er my heart</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Err from the orbit of its love;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When even the bliss-bright stars will start</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Earthwards, some lower sphere to prove.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou wilt forgive, if soft white arms</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Embrace, by fits, this breast of mine;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When, while amid their pillowy charms,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My heart can kiss no heart but thine;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And if these lips but rarely pine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In the pale abstinence of sorrow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It is, that nightly I divine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As I this world-sick soul recline,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I shall be with thee ere the morrow.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou wilt forgive, if once with thee</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I limned the outline of a Heaven;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But go and tell our God, from me,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He must forgive what He hath given;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, if we be by passion driven</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To love, and all its natural madness,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Tell Him, that man by love hath thriven,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And that by love he shall be shriven;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For God is love where love is gladness.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou wilt forgive, if clay-bound mind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Can scarce discover that thou art;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But wait! I feel the outward wind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rush fresh into my fluttering heart.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Perchance thy spirit stays in yon mild star</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In peace, and flame-like purity, and prayer;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, oh! when mine shall fly om earth afar,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I will pray God that it may join thine there:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>’Twere doubling Heaven, that Heaven with thee to share.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, while thou leadest music and her lyre,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like a sunbeam holden by its golden hair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>May I, too, mingling with the immortal choir,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Love thee, and worship God! what more may soul desire?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Enough for me! but, if there be</span>
									<br/>
									<span>More, it shall be left for thee.</span>
