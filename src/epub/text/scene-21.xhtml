								<br/>
								<span>Which represent and rule created life⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The love of self, our fellows, and our God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In all throughout one common feeling reigns:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each doth maintain and is maintained by the other;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All are compatible⁠—all needful; one</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To life⁠—to virtue one⁠—and one to bliss;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which thus together make the power, the end,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the perfection of created Being.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From these three principles doth every deed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Desire, and will, and reasoning, good or bad, come;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To these they all determine⁠—sum and scheme:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The three are one in centre and in round;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wrapping the world of life as do the skies</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our world. Hail! air of love by which we live!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How sweet, how fragrant! Spirit, though unseen⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Void of gross sign⁠—is scarce a simple essence,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Immortal, immaterial, though it be.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One only simple essence liveth⁠—God⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Creator, uncreate. The brutes beneath,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The angels high above us, with ourselves,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are but compounded things of mind and form.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In all things animate is therefore cored</span>
								<br/>
								<span>An elemental sameness of existence;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For God, being Love, in love created all,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As He contains the whole, and penetrates.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Seraphs love God, and angels love the good:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We love each other; and these lower lives,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which walk the earth in thousand diverse shapes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>According to their reason, love us too:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The most intelligent affect us most.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nay, man’s chief wisdom’s love⁠—the love of God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The new religion⁠—final perfect, pure⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was that of Christ and love. His great command⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His all-sufficing precept⁠—was’t not love?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Truly to love ourselves we must love God⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To love God we must all His creatures love⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To love His creatures, both ourselves and Him.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus love is all that’s wise, fair, good, and happy.</span>

								<span>I dreamed once that the night came down to me;</span>

								<span>And looked into me with his thousand eyes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that made me unhappy; but it passed,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>And Heaven. The many petty common thoughts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On which we daily tread, as it were, make one,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And above which few look; the other is</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That high and welkin-like infinity⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The brighter, upper half of the mind’s world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thick with great sun-like and constellate thoughts;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in the night of mind, which is our sleep,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>These thoughts shine out in dreams. Dreams double life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They are the heart’s bright shadow on life’s flood;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And even the step from death to deathlessness⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From this earth’s gross existence unto Heaven⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can scarce be more than from the harsh hot day</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To sleep’s soft scenes, the moonlight of the mind.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The wave is never weary of the wind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But in mountainous playfulness leaps to it</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Always; but mind gets weary of the world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And glooms itself in sleep, like a sweet smile,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Line by line, settling into proper sadness;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For sleep seems part of our immortality:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And why should any thing that dies be sad?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Last night I dreamed I walked within a hall⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The inside of the world. Long shroud-like lights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lit up its lift-like dome and pale wide walls,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Horizon-like; and every one was there:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It was the house of Death, and Death was there.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We could not see him, but he was a feeling:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We knew he was around us⁠—heard us⁠—eyed us;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But where wast thou? I never met thee once.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all was still as nothing; or as God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Deep judging, when the thought of making first</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quickened and stirred within Him; and He made</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All Heaven at one thought as at a glance.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Noise was there none; and yet there was a sound</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which seemed to be half like silence, half like sound.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All crept about still as the cold wet worms,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which slid among our feet, we could not scape from.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bound me were ruined fragments of dead gods⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Those shadows of the mystery of One⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the red worms, too, flourished over these,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For marble is a shadow weighed with mind;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each being, as men of old believed, distinct</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In form, and place, and power. But Oh! not all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The gathered gods of Eld could shine like ours,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No more than all yon stars could make a sun.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But truly then men lived in moral night,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Neath a dim starlight of religious truth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I felt my spirit’s spring gush out more clear,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gazing on these: they beautified my mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As rocks and flowers reflected do a well.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mind makes itself like that it lives amidst,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And on; and thus, among dreams, imaginings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And scenes of awe, and purity, and power,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Grows sternly sweet and calm⁠—all beautiful</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With god-like coldness and unconsciousness</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of mortal passion, mental toil; until,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to the marble model of a god,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It doth assume a firm and dazzling form,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Scarcely less incorruptible than that</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It emblems: and so grew, methought, my mind.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Matter hath many qualities; mind, one:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is irresistible: pure power⁠—pure god.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While wandering on I met what seemed myself:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was it not strange that we should meet, and there?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But all is strange in dreaming, as in death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And waking, as in life: nought is not strange.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Methought that I was happy, because dead.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All hurried to and fro; and many cried</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To each other⁠—Can I do thee any good?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But no one heeded: nothing could avail:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world was one great grave. I looked, and saw</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Time on his two great wings⁠—one, night⁠—one, day⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fly, moth-like, right into the flickering sun;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So that the sun went out, and they both perished.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And one gat up and spake⁠—a holy man⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Exhorting them; but each and all cried out⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Go to!⁠—it helps not⁠—means not: we are dead.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Death spake no word methought, but me he made</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Speak for him; and I dreamed that I was Death;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then, that Death only lived: all things were mixed;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Up and down shooting, like the brain’s fierce dance</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a delirium, when we are apt to die.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hell is my heir; what kin to me is Heaven?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bring out your hearts before me. Give your limbs</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To whom ye list or love. My son, Decay,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will take them: give them him. I want your hearts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That I may take them up to God. There came</span>
								<br/>
								<span>These words among us, but we knew not whence;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It was as if the air spake. And there rose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of the earth a giant thing, all earth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His eye was earthy, and his arm was earthy:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He had no heart. He but said, I am Decay;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, as he spake, he crumbled into earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the was nothing of him. But we all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lifted our faces up at the word, God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And spied a dark star high above in the midst</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of others, numberless as are the dead.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all plucked out their hearts, and held them in</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their right hands. Many tried to pick out specks</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And stains, but could not: each gave up his heart.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And something⁠—all things⁠—nothing⁠—it was Death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Said, as before, from air⁠—Let us to God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And straight we rose, leaving behind the raw</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Worms and dead gods, all of us⁠—soared and soared</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Right upwards, till the star I told thee of</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Looked like a moon⁠—the moon became a sun:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sun⁠—there came a hand between the sun and us,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And its five fingers made five nights in air.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God tore the glory from the sun’s broad brow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And flung the flaming scalp off flat to Hell.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I saw Him do it; and it passed close by us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then I heard a long, cold, skeleton scream,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like a trumpet whining through a catacomb,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which made the sides of that great grave shake in.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I saw the world and vision of the dead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dim itself off⁠—and all was life! I woke,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And felt the high sun blazoning on my brow</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His own almighty mockery of woe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fierce and infinite laugh at things which cease.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hell hath its light⁠—and Heaven; he burns with both.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And my dream broke, like life from the last limb⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quivering; so loth I felt to let it go,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Just as I thought I had caught sight of Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It came to nought, as dreams of Heaven on earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Do always.</span>
