								<span>I’ll quaff the nectar in thy flowers, and press</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The richest clusters of thy luscious fruit</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into the cup of my desires. I know</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My years are numbered not in units yet.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But I cannot live unless I love and am loved;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unless I have the young and beautiful</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bound up like pictures in my book of life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is the intensest vanity alone</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which makes us bear with life. Some seem to live,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose hearts are like those unenlightened stars</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the first darkness⁠—lifeless, timeless, useless⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With nothing but a cold night air about them;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not suns⁠—not planets⁠—darkness organized:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Orbs of a desert darkness: with no soul</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To light its watchfire in the wilderness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And civilize the solitude one moment.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There are such seemingly; but how or why</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They live I know not. This to me is life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That if life be a burden, I will join</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To make it but the burden of a song:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I hate the world’s coarse thought. And this is life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To watch young beauty’s budlike feelings burst</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And load the soul with love;⁠—as that pale flower,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which opes at eve, spreads sudden on the dark</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its yellow bloom, and sinks the air down with sweets.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let Heaven take all that’s good⁠—Hell all that’s foul;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Leave us the lovely! and we will ask no more.</span>
