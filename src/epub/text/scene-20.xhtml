								<span>He wrote of youth as passionate genius,</span>

								<span>Its flights and follies⁠—both its sensual ends</span>

								<span>And common places. To behold an eagle</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Spirit-informed, expands; and over all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The spiritual harmonies of Heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By the raised soul are heard, and God’s great rule</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To creatures justified. And next we find</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ourselves in Heaven. Even man’s deadly life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can be there, by God’s leave. Once brought to God,</span>

								<span>And what is in them. Let it not be said</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He sought his God in the self-slayer’s way,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose highest aim was but to worship in</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All humbleness; for he was called thereto,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To show the holy God, in three scenes, first</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And last in Threelihood, and midst in One:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Although less hard to shape the wide-winged wind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er the bright heights of air. He will forgive:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For we, this moment, and all living souls⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All matter, are as much within his presence,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And known through, like a glass film in the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As we can ever be. Through sundry worlds</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The mortal wends, returning, and relates</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To her he loves⁠—and joyously, they greet,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As boat by breeze and billow backed by tide⁠—</span>
								<br/>

								<br/>
								<span>Where spiritual natures, kind and high,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Light-born, which can divine immortal things,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Abide embosomed in Eternity.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Something he tells, too, of the friendly fiend,</span>

								<span>Something of ancient ages, infant Earth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To this succeeds a scene explaining much,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of retrospective and prospective cast,</span>

								<span>Our story ties us here to earth again,</span>

								<span>Dreams are mind-clouds, high, and unshapen beauties,</span>

								<span>Or but God-shaped, like mountains, which contain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Much and rich matter; often not for us,</span>

								<span>Told by the youth to his truthful, trustful, love;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who, light and lowly as a little glow-worm,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sheddeth her beauty round her like a rose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sweet smelling dew upon the ground it grows on.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then a rest in light, as though ’tween earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Heaven there were a mediate spirit point,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A bright effect original of God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Enlightening all ways, inwardly and round.</span>

								<span>Then comes a scene of passion, brought about</span>

								<span>Laid by the lonely seashore, as before,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where the great waves come in frothed, like a horse</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Put to his heart-burst speed, sobbing up hill,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wherein he works his victim’s death, to clear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His way, and keep his name of murderer;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As he in other parts makes good his titles,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Deceiver, liar, tempter, and accuser;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hater of man, and, most of all, of God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In the next scene we picture back our life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Contrasting the pure joys of earlier years,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With the unsatedness of current sin;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the sad feel that love’s own heart turns sick</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like a bad pearl; but that the feeling still</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is adamantine, though the splendid thing</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whereon it writes its record, is of all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Frailest; and though earth shows to good and bad,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The same blind kindness, beautiful to see,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wherewith our lovely mother loveth us,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world in vain unbosometh her beauty,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We have no lust to live; for things may be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Corrupted into beauty; and that love,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where all the passions blend, as hues in white,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tires at the last, as day would, if all day</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And no night. So despair of heart increases.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The last lure⁠—power⁠—is proffered, taken. All</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hangs on the last desire, whatever it be.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A scene of prescient solitude and soul</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Commune with heaven, repentance, prayer, faith,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which are all things inspired alone of God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who signifies salvation, follows this.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In the next scene, we feel the end draw nigh.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A change is wrought on earth as great as that</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In its first ages, when the elements</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Less gross and palpable than air, were changed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To mountainous and adamantine mass,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now ’neath the feet of nations;⁠—figuring forth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fateful mind which is to govern all,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Controlling the great evil; for it is mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which shall rule and be ruled, and not the body,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In the last age of human sway on earth;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ambition ruined by its own success;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Aims lost, power useless: love, pure love, the last</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of mortal things that nestles in the heart.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is a love which acts to death, and through death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And may come white, and bright and pure, like paper,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From refuse, or from clearest things at first;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is beyond the accidents of life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For things we make no compt of, have in them</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The seeds of life, use, beauty, like the cores</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of apples that we fling away;⁠—nought now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is left but trust in God, who tries the heart</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And saves it, at the last, from its own ruin⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The parting spirit fluttering like a flag,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Half from its earthy staff. The death-change comes.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Death is another life. We bow our heads</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At going out, we think, and enter straight</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Another golden chamber of the king’s,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Larger than this we leave, and lovelier.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then in shadowy glimpses, disconnect,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The story, flower like, closes thus its leaves.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The will of God is all in all. He makes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Destroys, remakes, for His own pleasure, all.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>After inferior nature is subdued,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The evil is confined. All elements</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Conglobe themselves from chaos, purified.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The rebegotten world is born again.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The body and the soul cease; spirit lives:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And gloriously falsified are all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Earth’s caverned prophecies of bodyhood.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Spirits rise up and rule and link with Heaven;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The soul state is searched into; dormant Death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Evil, and all the dark gods of the heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the idolatrous passions, ruined, chained,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And worshipless, are seen; and there, the Word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Heard and obeyed;⁠—next comes the truth divine,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Redintergrative; Evil’s last and worst,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Endeavour, vanquished⁠—by Almighty good.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The last scene shows the final doom of earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Soul’s judgment, and salvation of the youth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As was fore-fixed on from and in the first:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The universe expurgated of evil,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And hell for aye abolished; all create,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Redeemed, their God all love, themselves all bliss.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We may say that the sun is dead and gone</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ever; and may swear he will rise no more;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The skies may put on mourning for their God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And earth heap ashes on her head: but who</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall keep the sun back, when he thinks to rise?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where is the chain shall bind him? Where the cell</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall hold him? Hell, he would burn down to embers;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And would lift up the world with a lever of light</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of his way: yet, know ye, ’twere thrice less</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To do thrice this, than keep the soul from God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er earth, and cloud, and sky, and star, and Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It dwells with God uprisen as a prayer.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The spirit speaks of God in Heaven’s own tongue,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No mystery to those who love, but learned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As is our mother tongue, om Him, the parent;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By whom created, fashioned, flesh and spirit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All forms and feelings of all kinds of beauty</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are burned into our heart-clay, pattern like.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Much too is writ, elsewhere and here, not yet,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Made clear, nor can be till earth come of age;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the unfinished rudiments of light</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which gather time by time into a star.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus have I shown the meaning of the book,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the most truthful likeness of a mind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which hath as yet been limned; the mind of youth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In strengths and failings, in its overcomings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in its short comings; the kingly ends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The universalizing heart of youth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its love of power, heed not how had, although</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With surety of self-ruin at the end.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Every thing urged against it proves its truth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And faithfulness to nature. Some cried out</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Twas inconsistent; so ’twas meant to be.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such is the very stamp of youth and nature;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the continual losing sight of its aims,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the desertion of its most expressed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And dearest rules and objects, this is youth.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Lifting it to the light, where most it needs.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The thoughts we have of men are bold as men;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our thoughts of God are thin and fleet as ghosts;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But it was not his meaning to draw men,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such as he heard they were in the old world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sometimes mixed with; he blessed God he knew</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But little of the world, that little good;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While some sighed out that little was its all.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So for the persons and the scenes he drew,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oft in a dim and dreamy imagery</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shapen, half-shapen, mis-shapen, unshapen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They are the shadowy creatures which youth dreams</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Live in the world embodied, but are not,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Save in the mind’s, which is the mightier one.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They are the names of things which we believe in,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ideas not embodied, alas, not!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the sad fate which many of those meet</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom the youth loves and quits, means nought so ill</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As the betrayer’s sin, salvationless</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Almost: it is but desertion, not betrayal;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And forced on him according to a promise,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Made at the first unto him, and to be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wrought out in brief time; and the same fair souls</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Saved, stand for our desires made pure in Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let us work out our natures; we can do</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No wrong in them, they are divine, eterne:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I follow my attraction, and obey</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nature, as earth does, circling round her source</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of life and light, and keeping true in Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though not perfect in round, which nothing is.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Twas the heart-book of love, well nigh all grief.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the heart leaves its likeness best in that</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Overwhelming sorrow which burns up and buries,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to the eloquent impression left</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In lava, of Pompeian maiden’s bosom.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All passions, and all pleasures, and all powers</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of man’s heart, are brought in, and mind and frame.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He made this work the business of his life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It was his mission; and was laid on him.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He was a labourer on the ways of God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And had his hire in peace and power to work.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He wrote it not in the contempt of rule,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And not in hate; but in the self made rule</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That there was none to him, but to himself</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He was his sole rule, and had right to be.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The faults are faults of nature, and prove art</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Man’s nature, that a thing of art, like it,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Should be so pure in kind.</span>

								<span>Thyself, thy race, thy love,</span>

								<span>The faithless and the full of faith in God;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy race’s destiny, thy sacred love.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Every believer is God’s miracle.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nothing will stand whose staple is not love;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The love of God, or man, or lovely woman;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The first is scarely touched, the next scarce felt,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The third is desecrated; lift it up;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Redeem it, hallow it, blend the three in one</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Great holy work. It shall be read in Heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By all the saved of sinners of all time;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Preachers shall point to it, and tell their wards</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is a handful off eternal truth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Make ye a heartful of it: men shall will</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That it be buried with them in their hands:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The young, the gay, the innocent, the brave,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fair, with soul and body both all love,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall run to it with joy; and the old man,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Still hearty in decline, whose happy life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath blossomed downwards, like the purple bell-flower,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Closing the book, shall utter lowlily⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Death, thou art infinite, it is life is little.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Believe thou art inspired, and thou art.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Look at the bard and others; never heed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The petty hints of envy. If a fault</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It be in bard to deem himself inspired,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis one which hath had many followers</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Before him. He is wont to make, unite,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Believe; the world to part, and doubt, and narrow.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That he believes, he utters. What the world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Utters, it trusts not. But the time may come</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When all, along with those who seek to raise</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men’s minds, and have enough of pain, without</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Suffering from envy, may be God-inspired</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To utter truth, and feel like love for men.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Poets are henceforth the world’s teachers. Still</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world is all in sects, which makes one loathe it.</span>
